\ifdefined\ENGLISH

The book you currently see is \href{http://beginners.re/}{free} and is \href{https://github.com/dennis714/RE-for-beginners/}{available in opensource form}.
But sometimes I need to do something for money, so sorry in advance for placing my advertisement right here.

I can't accept full-time job offers, I mostly work remotely on small tasks, like these:

\Large Decrypting a database, managing unknown type of files \normalsize

Due to NDA agreement, I can't reveal many details about the last case, but the case in \href{http://yurichev.com/blog/encrypted_DB_case_1/}{"Encrypted database case \#1"} article is heavily based on a real case.

\Large Rewriting some kind of old EXE or DLL file back to C/C++ \normalsize

\Large Dongles \normalsize

Occasionally I do \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_protection_dongle}{software copy-protection dongle} replacements or dongle emulators. In general, it is somewhat unlawful to break software protection, so I can do this only if these conditions are met:

\begin{itemize}
\item software company who developed the software product does not exist anymore to my best knowledge;
\item the software product is older than 10 years;
\item you have a dongle to read information from it. In other words, I can only help to those who still uses some very old software, completely satisfied with it, but afraid of dongle electrical breakage and there are no company who can still sell the dongle replacement. 
\end{itemize}

These includes ancient MS-DOS and UNIX software. Software for exotic computer architectures (like MIPS, DEC Alpha, PowerPC) accepted as well.

Examples of my work you may find here:

\begin{itemize}
\item My book devoted to reverse engineering has a part about copy-protection dongles:
