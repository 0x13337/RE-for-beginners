Note to proofreaders:

Aside from LaTeX markup, there are only 3 macros you may be aware of.

"IFRU{russian text}{english text}" is a macro used for bilingual strings.
English proofreaders may completely ignore first part of macro, and russian
proofreaders may ignore second part.

Other two macros are:

"RU{russian text}" and "EN{english text}" used in places where the string of one specific
language should be present.
