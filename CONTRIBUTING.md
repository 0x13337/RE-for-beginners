============

Proofreading
------------

Aside from LaTeX markup, there are only 2 macros you may be aware of.

"\RU{russian text}" and "\EN{english text}" used in places where the string of one specific language should be present.

Translating
-----------

Read [here](https://github.com/dennis714/RE-for-beginners/blob/master/Translation.md).

Adding comments to source code
------------------------------

Commenting right in the LaTeX source code may be good idea.
LaTeX comments are started with percent ('%') sign.

It's fine to write comments like:
"I would love to read more about X and Y right here at this place",
"It's great idea to mention also X and Y".

[For example](https://github.com/dennis714/RE-for-beginners/blob/b0fe5ef304fa3303c502c4f94ee147683a2ffb50/patterns/main.tex#L105).

When time will allow me, I will try to extend these parts.
