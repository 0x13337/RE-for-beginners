\subsection{Summary}

It's possible to do a buffer overflow in Java?
No, because array length is always present in array object, 
array bounds are controlled, and exception is to be raised in case of out-of-bounds access.

There are no multi-dimensional arrays in Java in a C/C++ sense, so Java is not very suited
for fast scientific computations. 
Perhaps, it's payback for memory safety, which is absent in C/C++.
