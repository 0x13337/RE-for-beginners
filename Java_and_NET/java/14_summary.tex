\section{Summary}

What is missing in Java in comparison to C/C++?

\begin{itemize}
\item Structures: use classes.
\item Unions: use class hierarchies.
\item Unsigned data types.
\item Function pointers.
\end{itemize}

By the way, absence of unsigned data types makes cryptographical 
algorithms somewhat harder to implement in Java.
