Translation
-----------

Want to translate this book to some other language?

Keep in mind, it's a very hard tedious work.
You'll need basic understanding of git, LaTeX and m4.
Aside from this, I do a lot of changes, so translators may need to syncronize their
work often.

But anyway, everything is simple: as you may see, all English text is enclosed in `\EN{}` 
LaTeX macro, all Russian text in `\RU{}`.
m4 (used here for assembly listings) has `_EN()` and` _RU()` macros.

Since translation work is very tedious and may be done gradually, try to start at ["patterns" directory] 
(https://github.com/dennis714/RE-for-beginners/tree/master/patterns).

Choose a new macro name, for example, `\FR{}` for French or `\PTBR{}` for Brazilian Portuguese.
Send me files you had changed to dennis(a)yurichev.com and I'll setup everything to build a book
in your language.

Since this work can be done collaboratively, you may also use [my forum](http://forum.yurichev.com/viewforum.php?f=6) for coordination.
Github may also be used as well.

All your work will be licensed, like this book, in CC BY-NC-ND terms.
Korean, Chinese and Farsi translations are reserved by publishers.
