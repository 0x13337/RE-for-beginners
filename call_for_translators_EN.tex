\Huge Call for translators!

You may want to help me with translation this work into languages other than English and Russian.
Just send me any piece of translated text (no matter how short) and I'll put it into my LaTeX source code.

\iffalse
For those who are not afraid of TeX: \href{https://github.com/dennis714/RE-for-beginners/blob/master/Translation.md}{read here}.
For those who afraid, you may just open PDF file in OpenOffice and gradually rewrite each sentence.
I'll copypaste your work back to my LaTeX source code.
There is even a better way: to my own experience, you can gain your motivation by translating short pieces of my book and posting them to your blog(s).
I can publish URLs to these your posts here and also in my twitter (\href{http://twitter.com/yurichev}{@yurichev}).
\fi

Speed isn't important, because this is open-source project, after all.
Your name will be mentioned as project contributor.
Korean, Chinese and Persian languages are reserved by publishers.
English and Russian versions I do by myself, but my English is still that horrible, so I'm very grateful for any notes about grammar, etc.
Even my Russian is also flawed, so I'm grateful for notes about Russian text as well!%

So do not hesitate to contact me: \GTT{\EMAIL}.
