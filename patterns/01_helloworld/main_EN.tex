Let's use the famous example from the book
``The C programming Language''\cite{Kernighan:1988:CPL:576122}:

\section{\Conclusion{}}

The main difference between x86/ARM and x64/ARM64 code is that the pointer to the string is now 64-bits in length.
Indeed, modern \ac{CPU}s are now 64-bit due to both the reduced cost of memory and the greater demand for it by modern applications. 
We can add much more memory to our computers than 32-bit pointers are able to address.
As such, all pointers are now 64-bit.
