\subsection{Passing function arguments}

The most popular way to pass parameters in x86 is called \q{cdecl}:

\begin{lstlisting}
push arg3
push arg2
push arg1
call f
add esp, 12 ; 4*3=12
\end{lstlisting}

\Gls{callee} functions get their arguments via the stack pointer.

Therefore, this is how the argument values are located in the stack before the execution of the \ttf{} function's very first instruction:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
\hline
ESP & return address \\
\hline
ESP+4 & \argument \#1, \MarkedInIDAAs{} \TT{arg\_0} \\
\hline
ESP+8 & \argument \#2, \MarkedInIDAAs{} \TT{arg\_4} \\
\hline
ESP+0xC & \argument \#3, \MarkedInIDAAs{} \TT{arg\_8} \\
\hline
\dots & \dots \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

For more information on other calling conventions see also section~(\myref{sec:callingconventions}).
It is worth noting that nothing obliges programmers to pass arguments through the stack. It is not a requirement.
One could implement any other method without using the stack at all.

A somewhat popular way among assembly language newbies is to pass arguments via global variables, like:

\lstinputlisting[caption=Assembly code]{patterns/02_stack/global_args.asm}

But this method has obvious drawback: \IT{do\_something()} function cannot call itself recursively (or via another function),
because it has to zap its own arguments.
The same story with local variables: if to hold them in global variables, the function couldn't call itself.
And this is also not thread-safe
\footnote{Correctly implemented, each thread would have its own stack with its own arguments/variables.}.
A method to store such information in stack makes this easier---it can hold as many function arguments and/or values,
as much space it has.

[\TAOCPvolI{}, 189] mentions even weirder schemes particularly convenient on IBM System/360.

So it is a convenient custom in x86 and ARM to use the stack for this purpose.

\par
By the way, the \gls{callee} function does not have any information about how many arguments were passed.
C functions with a variable number of arguments (like \printf) determine their number using format string specifiers (which begin with the \% symbol).

If we write something like:

\begin{lstlisting}
printf("%d %d %d", 1234);
\end{lstlisting}

\printf will print 1234, and then two random numbers, which were lying next to it in the stack.

\par
That's why it is not very important how we declare the \main function: as \main, \TT{main(int argc, char *argv[])} or \TT{main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])}.

In fact, the \ac{CRT}-code is calling \main roughly as:
	
\begin{lstlisting}
push envp
push argv
push argc
call main
...
\end{lstlisting}

If you declare \main as \main without arguments, they are, nevertheless, still present in the stack, but are not used.
If you declare \main as  \TT{main(int argc, char *argv[])},
you will be able to use first two arguments, and the third will remain \q{invisible} for your function.
Even more, it is possible to declare \TT{main(int argc)}, and it will work.
