\subsection{Passing function arguments}

The most popular way to pass parameters in x86 is called \q{cdecl}:

\begin{lstlisting}
push arg3
push arg2
push arg1
call f
add esp, 12 ; 4*3=12
\end{lstlisting}

\Gls{callee} functions get their arguments via the stack pointer.

Therefore, this is how the argument values are located in the stack before the execution of the \ttf{} function's very first instruction:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
\hline
ESP & return address \\
\hline
ESP+4 & \argument \#1, \MarkedInIDAAs{} \TT{arg\_0} \\
\hline
ESP+8 & \argument \#2, \MarkedInIDAAs{} \TT{arg\_4} \\
\hline
ESP+0xC & \argument \#3, \MarkedInIDAAs{} \TT{arg\_8} \\
\hline
\dots & \dots \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

It is worth noting that nothing obliges programmers to pass arguments through the stack. It is not a requirement.
One could implement any other method without using the stack at all.

For example, it is possible to allocate a space for arguments in the \gls{heap}, fill it and pass it to a function via a pointer to this block in the \EAX register. This will work
\footnote{For example, in the \q{The Art of Computer Programming} book by Donald Knuth, 
in section 1.4.1 dedicated to subroutines \cite[section 1.4.1]{Knuth:1998:ACP:521463},
we could read that one way to supply arguments to a subroutine is simply to list them after the \JMP instruction
passing control to subroutine. Knuth explains that this method was particularly convenient on IBM System/360.}.
% FIXME:
% I am unsure about what this comment means.
% My guess is that the arguments are put in the memory position after
% the jump instruction, so you could say:
% "one way to supply arguments to a subroutine is simply to list them in memory
% after the \JMP instruction that passes control to the subroutine."
% Right now, "after" also sounds like it refers to the time after
% the jump happens, which I think is too late.
However, it is a convenient custom in x86 and ARM to use the stack for this purpose.

\par
By the way, the \gls{callee} function does not have any information about how many arguments were passed.
C functions with a variable number of arguments (like \printf) determine their number using format string specifiers (which begin with the \% symbol).

If we write something like:

\begin{lstlisting}
printf("%d %d %d", 1234);
\end{lstlisting}

\printf will print 1234, and then two random numbers, which were lying next to it in the stack.

\par
That's why it is not very important how we declare the \main function: as \main, \TT{main(int argc, char *argv[])} or \TT{main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])}.

In fact, the \ac{CRT}-code is calling \main roughly as:
	
\begin{lstlisting}
push envp
push argv
push argc
call main
...
\end{lstlisting}

If you declare \main as \main without arguments, they are, nevertheless, still present in the stack, but are not used.
If you declare \main as  \TT{main(int argc, char *argv[])},
you will be able to use first two arguments, and the third will remain \q{invisible} for your function.
Even more, it is possible to declare \TT{main(int argc)}, and it will work.
