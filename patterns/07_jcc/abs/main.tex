\section{Calculating absolute value}
\label{sec:abs}

That's a simple function:

\lstinputlisting{abs.c}

\subsection{\Optimizing MSVC}

This is very usual way to generate it:

\lstinputlisting[caption=\Optimizing MSVC 2012 x64]{patterns/07_jcc/abs/abs_MSVC2012_Ox_x64.asm}

GCC 4.9 does mostly the same.

\ifdefined\IncludeARM
\subsection{\OptimizingKeilVI: \ThumbMode}

\lstinputlisting[caption=\OptimizingKeilVI: \ThumbMode]{patterns/07_jcc/abs/abs_Keil_thumb_O3.s}

\index{ARM!\Instructions!RSB}
ARM lacks negate instruction, so Keil compiler uses ``Reverse Subtract'' instruction, which just subtracts,
but with operands reversed.

\subsection{\OptimizingKeilVI: \ARMMode}

It's possible to add condition codes to some instructions in ARM mode, so that's what Keil compiler did:

\lstinputlisting[caption=\OptimizingKeilVI: \ARMMode]{patterns/07_jcc/abs/abs_Keil_ARM_O3.s}

Now there are no conditional jumps and this is good: \ref{branch_predictors}.

\subsection{\NonOptimizing GCC 4.9 (ARM64)}

\index{ARM!\Instructions!XOR}
ARM64 has NEG instruction for negating:

\lstinputlisting[caption=\Optimizing GCC 4.9 (ARM64)]{patterns/07_jcc/abs/abs_GCC49_ARM64_O0.s}
\fi

\ifdefined\IncludeMIPS
\subsection{MIPS}

\lstinputlisting[caption=\Optimizing GCC 4.4.5 (IDA)]{patterns/07_jcc/abs/MIPS_O3_IDA.lst}

\index{MIPS!\Instructions!BLTZ}
We see here new instruction: BLTZ (``Branch if Less Than Zero'').
\index{MIPS!\Instructions!SUBU}
\index{MIPS!\Pseudoinstructions!NEGU}
There are also NEGU pseudoinstruction, which is in fact does subtraction from zero.
U suffix in both SUBU and NEGU means no exception will be raised in case of integer overflow.

\fi

\subsection{Branchless version?}

There are also could be branchless version, which we will consider later: \ref{chap:branchless_abs}.
