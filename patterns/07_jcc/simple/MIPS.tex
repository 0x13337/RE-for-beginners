\subsection{MIPS}

One distinctive MIPS feature is absence of CPU flags.
Apparently, it was done so to simplify data dependency analysis.

\index{x86!\Instructions!SETcc}
\index{MIPS!\Instructions!SLT}
\index{MIPS!\Instructions!SLTU}
So there are instruction somewhat similar to SETcc in x86: SLT (``Set on Less Than'': signed version) and 
SLTU (unsigned version).
This instruction sets destination register value to 1 if condition is true or to 0 if otherwise.

\index{MIPS!\Instructions!BEQ}
\index{MIPS!\Instructions!BNE}
Register is then checked using BEQ (``Branch on Equal'') or BNE (``Branch on Not Equal'') 
instructions and jump is occurred.

So, this instruction pair should be used in MIPS for comparison and branch.

Let's first start with signed version of our function:

\lstinputlisting[caption=\NonOptimizing GCC 4.4.5 (IDA)]{patterns/07_jcc/simple/O0_MIPS_signed_IDA.lst}

``SLT REG0, REG0, REG1'' is reduced by IDA to its shorter form: ``SLT REG0, REG1''.
\index{MIPS!\Pseudoinstructions!BEQZ}
We also see there BEQZ pseudoinstruction (``Branch if Equal to Zero''), 
which is in fact ``BEQ REG, \$ZERO, LABEL''.

\index{MIPS!\Instructions!SLTU}
Unsigned version is just the same, but SLTU (unsigned version) is used instead of SLT:

\lstinputlisting[caption=\NonOptimizing GCC 4.4.5 (IDA)]{patterns/07_jcc/simple/O0_MIPS_unsigned_IDA.lst}
