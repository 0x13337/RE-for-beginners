\index{MIPS!\Instructions!JR}
There is now return from the function, because function is always finished with \puts call,
so there we see jump to \puts (JR: ``Jump Register'') rather than jump and link.
We talked about this earlier: \ref{JMP_instead_of_RET}.

\index{MIPS!Load delay slot}
We also often see NOP instructions after LW ones. This is ``load delay slot'': another delay slot in MIPS.
\index{MIPS!\Instructions!LW}
Instruction next to LW may execute at the moment when LW loads value from memory. 
Modern MIPS CPUs has a feature to wait if next instruction uses result of LW, so this is somewhat outdated,
but GCC still adds NOPs for older MIPS. 
In general, it can be ignored.
