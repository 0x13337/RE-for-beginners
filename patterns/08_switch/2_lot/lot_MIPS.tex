\index{MIPS!\Instructions!SLTIU}
There are new instruction to us: SLTIU (``Set on Less Than Immediate Unsigned''). 
\index{MIPS!\Instructions!SLTU}
In fact, this is the same as SLTU (``Set on Less Than Unsigned''), but ``I'' means ``immediate'', i.e., 
a number is to be specified in the instruction.

\index{MIPS!\Instructions!BNEZ}
BNEZ is ``Branch if Not Equal to Zero''.

Code is very same as for other \ac{ISA}s.
\index{MIPS!\Instructions!SLL}
SLL (``Shift Word Left Logical'') does multiplication by 4. 
MIPS is 32-bit CPU after all, so all addresses in jumptable are 32-bit ones.
