And again, we see here LUI loading 32-bit part of double number into \$V0.
And again, I honestly don't know why.

\index{MIPS!\Instructions!MFC1}
New instruction for us here is MFC1 (``Move From Coprocessor 1''). 
FPU is coprocessor number 1, hence 1 in instruction name.
This instruction transfers values from coprocessor's registers to main CPU registers.
So the result from pow() execution is finally moved into registers \$A3 and \$A2, 
\printf will take 64-bit double value from this registers pair.
