\subsection{MIPS}

\index{MIPS!\Registers!FCCR}
MIPS FPU coprocessor has one condition bit which can be set in FPU and checked in CPU.
Earlier MIPS-es has only one condition bit (called FCC0), later has 8 (called FCC7-FCC0).
These bits are located in register named FCCR.

\index{MIPS!\Instructions!C.LT.D}
``C.LT.D'' is comparing two values. ``LT'' is condition (``Less Than''). ``D'' mean \Tdouble values.
Depending on comparison result, FCC0 condition bit is set or cleared.

\index{MIPS!\Instructions!BC1T}
\index{MIPS!\Instructions!BC1F}
``BC1T'' checks for FCC0 bit and takes jump if bit is set. ``T'' mean jump taken if bit is set (``True'').
There are also instruction ``BC1F'' which takes jump if bit is cleared (``False'').

Depending on jump, one of function arguments is placed into \$F0 register.
