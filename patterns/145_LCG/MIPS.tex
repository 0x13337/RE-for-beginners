Wow, we see here only one constant (0x3C6EF35F or 1013904223).
Where is another one (1664525)?

It seems, multiplication by 1664525 is done using just shifts and additions!
Let's check this assumption:

\lstinputlisting{patterns/145_LCG/test.c}

\lstinputlisting[caption=\Optimizing GCC 4.4.5 (IDA)]{patterns/145_LCG/test_O3_MIPS.lst}

Indeed!

\subsection{MIPS relocations}

I would also focus on how load and stores are actually works. 
The listings here are produced by IDA, which hiding some details.

I'll run objdump twice to get disassembled listing and also relocations list:

\lstinputlisting[caption=\Optimizing GCC 4.4.5 (objdump)]{patterns/145_LCG/MIPS_O3_objdump.txt}

Let's work out two relocations for the my\_srand() function.
First is R\_MIPS\_HI16 for address 0 and second is R\_MIPS\_LO16 for address 8.
That means that address of beginning of .bss segment will be written into instructions at
address of 0 (high part of address) and 8 (low part of address).

rand\_state variable is at the very start of .bss segment.

So we see zeroes in the instructions LUI and SW, because nothing is there yet --- compiler don't know what
to write there.
Linker will fix this and high part of address will be written into LUI instruction operand and
low part of address --- to operand of SW instruction. 
SW will sum up low part of address and what is in \$V0 register (high part is there).

The same story about my\_rand() function: R\_MIPS\_HI16 relocation instructs linker to write high part
of .bss segment into LUI instruction.
So, high part of rand\_state variable address will reside in \$V1 register.
LW instruction at address 0x10 will sum up high and low part and load value of rand\_state into \$V1.
SW instruction at address 0x54 will also do the summing and then store value to rand\_state global variable.

So, IDA processes relocations while loading, thus hiding these details.
But we should remember about them.
