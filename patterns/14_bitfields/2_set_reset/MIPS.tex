ORI, of course, OR operation. ``I'' in instruction name mean that value is embedded into instruction.

\index{MIPS!\Instructions!AND}
On contrast, here is AND. There was no way to use ANDI because it's not possible to embed 0xFFFFFDFF number
into one single instruction, so compiler ought to load 0xFFFFFDFF value into \$V0 register first and then generate
AND which take all the values from registers.
