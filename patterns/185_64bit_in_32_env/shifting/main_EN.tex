Shifting also occurs in two passes: first the lower part is shifted, then the higher part.
But the lower part is shifted with the help of the \INS{SHRD} instruction, it shifts the value of \EDX{} by 7 bits, but pulls new bits
from \EAX{}, i.e., from the higher part.
The higher part is shifted using the more popular \SHR{} instruction: indeed, the freed bits in the higher part
must be filled with zeroes.

\subsubsection{ARM}

ARM doesn't have such instruction as \INS{SHRD} in x86, so the Keil compiler ought to do this using simple shifts and \INS{OR} operations:

\subsubsection{MIPS}

GCC for MIPS follows the same algorithm as Keil does for Thumb mode:
