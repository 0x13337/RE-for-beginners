\section{vprintf() function case}

Many programmers define their own logging functions which takes printf-like format string + 
variable number of arguments.

Another popular example is die() function, which prints some message and exits.
We need some way to pack input arguments of unknown number and pass them to printf() function.
But how?
That's why there are functions with ``v'' in name.
One of them is vprintf(): it takes format-string and pointer of \TT{va\_list} type:

\lstinputlisting{patterns/25_variadic_functions/die.c}

By closer examination, we may see that \TT{va\_list} is a pointer to an array.
Let's compile:

\lstinputlisting[caption=\Optimizing MSVC 2010]{patterns/25_variadic_functions/die_MSVC2010_Ox.asm}

We see that all our function does is just takes a pointer passes it to vprintf() and it will
treat it like an infinite array of arguments!
