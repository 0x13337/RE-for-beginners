\section{Instructions}

There are 3 kinds of instructions:

\begin{itemize}

\item R-type: those which has 3 registers.
R-instruction are often has the following form:

\begin{lstlisting}
instruction destination, source1, source2
\end{lstlisting}

One important thing to remember is that when first and second register is the same, 
IDA may show it in shorter form:

\begin{lstlisting}
instruction destination/source1, source2
\end{lstlisting}

That somewhat reminds us Intel-syntax of x86 assembly language.

\item I-type: those which has 16-bit immediate value.
\item J-type: jump/branch instructions, has 26 bits for offset encoding.

\end{itemize}
